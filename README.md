# Spring-2019-BubbleBurst

This was the final project for an introductory game progamming class. I worked with 2 other students to design and create an original 2D game using javascript and Phaser. The game design document can be found at https://bubbleburst-1.firebaseapp.com/benchmark1 and the game is being hosted at https://bubbleburst-1.firebaseapp.com.
